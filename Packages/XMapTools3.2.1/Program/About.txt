 |  XMapTools version 3.2.1  -  Released on 02.08.2019 |
  -----------------------------------------------------

This XMapTools 3.2.1 update is strongly recommended for all users and contains several new features as well as improvements to stability and compatibility. This update:

- Improve significantly the compatibility and stability of the Graphical User Interface
- Improve the integration of XMapToolsâ€™ add-ons - XMapTools 3.2 is fully compatible with add-on independent setup and auto update. These changes anticipates the deployment of XThermoTools 1.1 beta scheduled in August 2019  
- Introduce a new set of colourblind-friendly colormaps based on perceptual palettes with smoother and more linear profiles than the palettes originally used in XMapTools. Consequently, it is no longer recommended to use either JET or ColdWarm color palettes. There is a good chance that both will be removed in a future version. Additional details concerning the choice of the color palette are provided in the user guide 
- The color palette and the scale settings (logarithmic or linear) can now be accessed directly via the left menu. However, saving these as default settings requires going in the menu File > Preferences 
- Add an option to flip up and down the colours of the selected color palette. This option is accessible via the menu File > Preferences. Note that this feature is only compatible with the new color palettes which are defined in /Dev/XMap_ColorMaps.txt
- Improve the compatibility of the modules with the new color palettes. The active color palette and filters are transfered and used in the modules displaying maps (expect RGB)
- Add to the <advanced Standardisation method> a subroutine generating a file containing the theoretical limits of detection (LOD) for each element. Note that these limits are robust only for X-ray maps if the background value is > 1, otherwise a generic minimal uncertainty is assumed
- Add a new functionality to filter in Quanti the concentrations below detection limit. This feature requires either a file <LOD.txt> in the working directory containing the element names and the detection limits (same unit as the map), or a LOD file generated by the advanced standardisation module in the folder LOD (more details concerning the format of these files are given in the user guide)
- Add a new correction in the workspace Quanti to re-normalise the mixing pixels having an unrealistically high sum of oxide. These pixels can be generated by the advance standardisation methods for elements that are closed to the detection limit in the phase of interest (e.g. Si in calcite) but highly concentrated in the surrounding phase (e.g. Si in quartz). In this case, concentrations > 100 % are generated for the mixing pixels as Si is calibrated with the calibration curve of calcite. The correction can renormalise the composition of the mixing pixels having a sum above a given threshold. Auto and manual modes are available  
- Add a mode <Convert from wt% of oxide to ppm of element> in the function <Transfer to quanti>. This correction is based on the conversion factors listed in the file /XMapTools/Program/Dev/XMap_ConversionFactors.txt
- Add a menu <Workspace> for quick access to the workspaces. Note that the buttons of the tab remains active in this version
- Provide a new external function for the structural formula of titanite by Jesse Walters
- Provide a new external function for Ti-in-Qz thermobarometry based on the calibration of Thomas et al. (2010) by Regiane Andrade Fumes


Other changes:  

- The Mn map has been corrected in the function StructFctGarnet.m - Note: Xsps was ok but not Mn expressed in apfu; thanks to Francesco Giuntoli for reporting this error
- Add Ti_M2 to the external functions StructFctAmphiboles.m and StructFctAmphiboles3.m; thanks to Michael Jentzer for this suggestion 
- The name of the button <Apply> in the TRC module has been changed to <Paste>
- The following map names were changed for improving compatibility (raw data -> calibrated): Fe3 -> Fe2O3; F -> F_m; CL_Ti  -> TiO2_Cl
- The XMapTools logo was updated
- Additional bug fixes

 DESCRIPTION
- - - - - - -

XMapTools provides advanced numerical tools in a guided environment to explore and visualise your data in your own way. It incorporates a large variety of options for data processing, data calibration and data visualisation via single and multi-channel maps or via binary, ternary and spider diagrams.

Please use the following citations in your publications when you refer to XMapTools. The version of the program should be specified just after the name, e.g. Mapping data were processed using XMapTools 3.1.1 (Lanari et al. 2014; 2018).

Please use at least one of the official XMapTools logo in your talk / poster along with the references while images have been generated using XMapTools.

XMapTools is distributed in an Double Regime: Academic and Commercial.

In the Academic and Public Research World, XMapTools is distributed under the terms of the Scientific Software Open Source Academic For Free License. This License sets the program and the code GRATIS and Open Source, and grants Freedom to use, copy, study, modify and redistribute it. But these policies hold only within the Academic and Public Research world. Thus the Academic World can be reassured that the normal research academic policies in working with scientific software are granted by this license. And it goes even beyond GNU-GPL, since it explicitly sets GRATIS the software.

On the other hand, we would like to reassure also the Commercial World. Indeed, the Scientific Software Open Source Academic For Free License IS NOT like other, commonly spread Open Source Free licenses, GNU-GPL or other. In the sense that the present License well keeps into account all the needs and the way of functioning of the Commercial and Profit Institutions World.

Into this world, XMapTools program is going to be distributed under other Licenses, to be negotiated from case to case. In this case it is a paying code, and exclusiveness for a certain merceological sector, or even full exclusiveness can be agreed with commercial institutions. This protects commercial institutions investements on applied research lines using the XMapTools code against concurrential actions, a posteriori possible to concurrent commercial institutions for codes licensed under commonly spread Open Source Free licenses. We agree with the Commercial World that these licenses revealed not compatible with the ordinary way of functioning in the Commercial World.

This is the reason why we choosed a different licence policy for XMapTools: to make Commercial Insitutions profit of the Basic Research ByProducts. And at the same time, to make the Basic Research benefit of the funding coming from the Commercial World, to finance the Basic Research itself.

Please, if you are a commercial institution, take the time to read at least the Preamble of the Scientific Software Open Source Academic For Free License. And you will realize that this is exactly the policy and the philosophy that can work to conciliate your way of functioning and the normal behaviour of academic research. Such as everybody can profit of the exchange between the two worlds.
