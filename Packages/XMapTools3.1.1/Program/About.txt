 |  XMapTools version 3.1.1  -  Released on 09.06.2019 |
  -----------------------------------------------------


This XMapTools 3.1.1 update is strongly recommended for all users and contains several new features as well as improvements to stability and compatibility. This update:

- Provide a major update to the graphical user interface (GUI) to improve the user experience. Changes include a new menu in the main XMapTools window and several graphical improvements to speed up the program. Many buttons have been removed compared to XMapTools 2 and the corresponding functions transferred to the menu. In XMapTools 3, the following functionalities are only available via the XMapTools’ menu: (1) Chemical modules; (2) the sampling tools ...
- Provide enhanced sampling tools including a new path mode. All sampling mode can be used for single or multiple maps with or without saving data and figures
- Provide a mosaic tool to assemble separate datasets into map mosaic. This functionality is useful to compare several maps of the same mineral within a single dataset
- Introduce a high-definition (HD) mode for a better compatibility with high-resolution screens; This mode can be activated using the command >> XMapTools HD. Note that this functionality is fully compatible with other XMapTools commands (e.g. >> XMapTools HD open MyProject | this command activates the HD mode and open the project MyProject.mat). 
- Introduce a new function that approximates the diameter of the interaction volume; this is a test version is only valid for an accelerating voltage of 15 KeV and a beam diameter of 1 micron (see Lanari & Picolli, 2019)
- Introduce a copy function (available in the menu or using PC: Ctrl+C; MAC: Cmd+C) that copy the displayed figure (as an image) to the clipboard. A message is displayed when the data are transferred. The figure can be pasted in any other program able to manipulate images. Note that you can also export the image and then use the default copy function of MATLAB (in the menu) to obtain an image with layers for further editing in Illustrator.  
- Provide the pixel fraction of the groups obtained via the k-means classification in the module Binary
- Add a new functionality About available in the menu File; it displays the last release notes and a short description of the program


Other changes:  

- Fix several issues in the zoom/pan functions including the possibility to reset to the full map view when the displayed element was changed 
- Display a warning box before filtering data in Quanti and Results
- Fix an issue in the function to merge mask files causing display issues if the last group ‘unselected_pixels’ was present; thanks to Thereza Yogi for reporting this error 
- Fix an issue that prevented the IDC module to apply vertical intensity-drift correction
- Fix several minor issue with button sizing and positioning in the main XMapTools’ window
- Fix minor display issues of the average map density; the program detects the unit used and updates the display accordingly
- Improve the merge function in QUANTI to be compatible with LA-ICP-MS maps
- Improve the function reading the file Standards.txt to deal with unusual formatting practices 
- Update the program XConvert_JEOL_SUN (1) the file O-cnd containing the dwell time is saved in the folder /Info/ (2) a special mode [-s] prevents the program to generate the files Classifications.txt and Standards.txt by using the command: XConvert_JEOL_SUN -s
- Additional bug fixes

Additional note:

- This version of XMapTools is only compatible with MATLAB 2014a and more recent versions of MATLAB. Check the XMapTools website for additional information if you are using a hold MATLAB version.
- The user guide has been updated; Lanari, P. (2019) An introduction to XMapTools. User-guide, version 2019-5-9

Please use the following citations in your publications when you refer to XMapTools. The version of the program should be specified just after the name, e.g. Mapping data were processed using XMapTools 3.1.1 (Lanari et al. 2014; 2018).

Please use at least one of the official XMapTools logo in your talk / poster along with the references while images have been generated using XMapTools.

 LICENSE

XMapTools is distributed in an Double Regime: Academic and Commercial.

In the Academic and Public Research World, XMapTools is distributed under the terms of the Scientific Software Open Source Academic For Free License. This License sets the program and the code GRATIS and Open Source, and grants Freedom to use, copy, study, modify and redistribute it. But these policies hold only within the Academic and Public Research world. Thus the Academic World can be reassured that the normal research academic policies in working with scientific software are granted by this license. And it goes even beyond GNU-GPL, since it explicitly sets GRATIS the software.

On the other hand, we would like to reassure also the Commercial World. Indeed, the Scientific Software Open Source Academic For Free License IS NOT like other, commonly spread Open Source Free licenses, GNU-GPL or other. In the sense that the present License well keeps into account all the needs and the way of functioning of the Commercial and Profit Institutions World.

Into this world, XMapTools program is going to be distributed under other Licenses, to be negotiated from case to case. In this case it is a paying code, and exclusiveness for a certain merceological sector, or even full exclusiveness can be agreed with commercial institutions. This protects commercial institutions investements on applied research lines using the XMapTools code against concurrential actions, a posteriori possible to concurrent commercial institutions for codes licensed under commonly spread Open Source Free licenses. We agree with the Commercial World that these licenses revealed not compatible with the ordinary way of functioning in the Commercial World.

This is the reason why we choosed a different licence policy for XMapTools: to make Commercial Insitutions profit of the Basic Research ByProducts. And at the same time, to make the Basic Research benefit of the funding coming from the Commercial World, to finance the Basic Research itself.

Please, if you are a commercial institution, take the time to read at least the Preamble of the Scientific Software Open Source Academic For Free License. And you will realize that this is exactly the policy and the philosophy that can work to conciliate your way of functioning and the normal behaviour of academic research. Such as everybody can profit of the exchange between the two worlds.
